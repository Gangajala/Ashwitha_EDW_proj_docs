This is the common session for all the students

Extract-->Transform-->Dataset Properties(Hierachies, Groups,Mark Date Table)-->Data Model (Relationships, Table Properties,
Column Properties, DAX Measures properties, Security)

Share to other people [PBIX, PBIT, Dataflow, PBI Dataset]


Read the complete theory about Data Modeling from the PDF.

Model Create Process In Brief:

a) Take the required data (queries) from sources
b) Transform data in the queries [Optional]
c)  Dataset level

	1. Create Hierarchies, Groups required for the report dataset.
	2.Mark Date table entries as Date Table in the 

Modeling Menu-->New Table 

DimDate=

ADDCOLUMNS 
(
CALENDAR (DATE(2017,1,1), DATE(2020,12,31)),

"DateAsInteger", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYYMMDD" ),
"Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
"Monthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "MM" ),
"YearMonthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/MM" ),
"YearMonthShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/mmm" ),
"MonthNameShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmm" ),
"MonthNameLong", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmmm" ),
"DayOfWeekNumber", WEEKDAY ( [Date] ),
"DayOfWeek", FORMAT ( [Date], "dddd" ),
"DayOfWeekShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "ddd" ),
"Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ),
"YearQuarter", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY" ) & "/Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" 
)

d) Go to Model Design

	1.Verify the existing relationships between tables.
	Note: Microsoft algorithms will connect automatically if the names, data types and values match.

	2. Connect or establish relationship from Query:Query

		Master Dimension Table to Child Dimension Table [ 1: Many]
		Dimension Table to Fact Table [1:Many]
	
		Note: It automatically make many to many between Dimension to Dimension. [Multiple 1:Many relationships 		make Many:Many]
	
		DimCourse[CourseID]-> FactPayments[CourseID]
		DimCourseMode[ModeID]-->FactPayments[ModeID]
		DimLocation[LocationID]-->FactPayments[LocationID]
		DimInstitute[InstituteID]-->FactPayments[InstituteID]
		DimStudent[StudentID]-->FactPayments[StudentID]
		DimUser[UserID]-->FactPayments[UserID]

		DimDate[Date]--> FactPayments[Date]
		DimDate[Date]--> FactPayments[Enquiry_Date]
		DimDate[Date]--> FactPayments[Join_Date]
		DimDate[Date]--> FactPayments[Course_End_Date]
		Note: DimDate is Role Playing Table

		DimGeography[GeographyID]--->DimLocation[GeographyID]

	3. 	Go to each Query/ Table specify table settings
		Name 
		Description
		Synonym
		Row Label: Display Label
		Key Column: Underlying evaluation value
		Storage Mode
		
	
	4. Ensure each column having appropriate settings

		a) Proper Name
		b) Description
		c) Display Folder classficiation [grouping columns for easy of operations]
		d) Synonyms [suitable for Q & A and other situations]
		e) Data Type [ important]
		f)  Format [important, how you want to show]
		g) Hidden / Non Hidden
		h) Sort column, Categorize column, Aggregate etc...
		
	5. Take Role Playing reference keys from DimDate to Fact Table
	6. Take Bidirectional relationship between FactPayments to DimCourse

	7. Size the Queries to show effectively [by holding corners or center resizing]

	
e)	Row Level Security Adding:
		a) Modeling menu--> manage roles-->create role
		b) Modeling menu--> view as roles and test it

f) 	Working on Important DAX measures and placing in the model for reusability purpose.
	
	DAX: Data Analysis Expressions
	Design Reason: Modeling and Analysis
	What it does?
	Helps to create new measure, column, and table for modeling and analysis purpose.

	New Measure: Returns single value after doing calculations
	New Column: Returns single column of values after doing calculations
	New Table: Returns set of columns to implement business logics

	Few Basic Language Elements:
	a) Similar to other languages, DAX also has its own elements [identifier, operator, keyword, functions etc...]
	b) It has many functions and multiple categories of functions available.
	
	Date, Filter, Math & Trig, Statistical, Information, Time Intelligence, Logical functions etc...

	Note: DAX is called as formula language or functional language

	
	Important real-time measures, columns, and tables.

	a) Modeling Menu--> New Table-->

DimDate=

ADDCOLUMNS 
(
CALENDAR (DATE(2000,1,1), DATE(2025,12,31)),

"DateAsInteger", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYYMMDD" ),
"Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
"Monthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "MM" ),
"YearMonthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/MM" ),
"YearMonthShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/mmm" ),
"MonthNameShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmm" ),
"MonthNameLong", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmmm" ),
"DayOfWeekNumber", WEEKDAY ( [Date] ),
"DayOfWeek", FORMAT ( [Date], "dddd" ),
"DayOfWeekShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "ddd" ),
"Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ),
"YearQuarter", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY" ) & "/Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" 
)


	b) New Columns creation
	c) New Measures Preperation
			
		1.Parent Measure [Fully Additive Measures]
		
				Total DF=sum(FactPayments[Discount_Fee])
				Total Actual Fee=sum(Factpayment[Actual_fee])
				Average Discount Fee=Average(Factpayments[Discount_fee])
				Count of students=Count(dimstudent[studentid])
			
		2. Child measure [Semi Additive Measures]

				Last year DF=calculate([Total DF],previousyear(dimdate[date]))

		3. Sub child / Sub dependent measure [Non additive measures is one of the category]
				Growth=[Total DF]-[Last Year DF]
			
		etc....
		Note: Individual measures also 

		4. Data Modeling functions usage
		
		Directions [single / both] using CROSSFILTER

		Total modes business = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(DimCourseMode[ModeID]),CROSSFILTER				(FactPayments[ModeID],DimCourseMode[ModeID],Both))

		Relationships establishment

		Total DF based on Enquiry_Date=CALCULATE([Total DF], USERELATIONSHIP(DimDate[Date],FactPayments		[Enquiry_Date]))



===========================================================================
How many ways the above model reusable?

a) PBIX file sharing [general] [on-premise]
b) PBIT file sharing [Power BI Template Sharing]: It takes only structure [on-premise]
c) Publishing to Service, ask the team to use Dataset  [cloud]
d) Create a Dataflow with similar design and use it [cloud]


Data Set Model Template Creation:
a) File Menu--> Export--> Power BI Template --> Name it and Browse to a location

Dataset Model Template Usage:
a) Open Power BI Desktop
b) File Menu--> Import--> Template-->Browse it
c) Go to Data Source Settings--> Change Source to the data feed you want to point to
d) Refresh ALL, so that from the pointed source it brings the dataWhat is the difference between Template Dataset and Normal Dataset?

Template Dataset : holds structure only
Normal Dataset: may hold data also [structure + data] 

What will you do after a proper Model Generation?

Use visuals and generate report

How do you share this Model to your colleagues or other members?

a) Create a Template [.pbit] and Share the Template
b) Publish Report, so that Dataset available at Power BI Service to reuse

When do we create Data Model for Power BI?

Before reporting starts in the organization

What is the Advantage of Data Model in Power BI?

Reusability

One single central data base / data set design  sharing to all the team to work on.

How do you establish runtime relationship between queries?

Using DAX Function: USERELATIONSHIP

How do you establish runtime directions (single / both) to queries?

Using DAX Function: CROSSFILTER

What kind of Power BI Data Model reusability companies are using now?

Data Flow creation and usage
